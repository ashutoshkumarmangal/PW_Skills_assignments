Ans 1-->> To create a object in Java we use new keyword.
          ClassName object = new ClassName();

Ans 2-->> It is used to create the object.
          It allocate the memory at runtime.
          All objects occupy memory in the heap area.

Ans 3-->> There are three different types of variable in java.
         1.local variable 
         2.Instance variable
         3. Static variable

Ans 4-->>Instance variable defined in class but outsede the body of methods.While local variable are defined as a type of variable declared within the blocks.

Instance variable can be accessed throughout the class. while local variable access is limited to the method in which it is declared.

Instance variable is not compulsory to initialise before use. while local variable is importance to initialise in local variable.

Ans 5-->> Memory for instance variable is allocated in heap area. while for local variable memory is allocated in stack.

Ans 6-->> Method Overriding is used when we use the same method again and again.
